- Commit changes when a logical feature is complete
- Use pre-commit hooks; unit tests and lints must pass
- Any database schema change MUST include a migration file
- Never modify committed migrations
- Commit messages must explain WHAT and WHY
- Mention migration names in commit messages when applicable
- Never introduce float for monetary values
- Any publish-affecting change must bump public_version and append outbox event
- Use rebase and keep commit history clean
